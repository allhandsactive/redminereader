redmine reader isn't actually specific to redmine, but it is specific to
awesome. redmine reader's job is to take an ATOM feed generated by redmine
and clear out all the crap they usually display with (poorly!), then package
that up nicely and shoot it out to an email address.

there's a config file you can include. but it has passwords in it, so you'll
have to make it yourself
